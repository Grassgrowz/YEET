# YEET
a pyside6 based program that has me guess the artist and arlmbum name based on the album cover, using data sourced from my offline music collection. a supplementary script constructs a csv database of the music on my computer.

abstract: program chooses a random album from my music collection and displays the album art (only choose song files that have album art). beneath the image, there are two buttons: "reveal artist", and "reveal "album", where upon pressing them, the information appears in a label widget between the image and the buttons. I will use this program to see how many artistnames or albumnames i can remember just by looking at the art.
